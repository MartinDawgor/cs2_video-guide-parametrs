Description of all bit flags/masks for console commands:

Cheat (FCVAR_CHEAT):
This command only works if sv_cheats is set to 1 on the server. These commands are blocked in regular matches (MM/Faceit).

Development only (FCVAR_DEVELOPMENTONLY):
This command exists in the code, but is cut or blocked in the release version of the game. It is only available to Valve developers in their internal builds.

Hidden (FCVAR_HIDDEN):
This command works, but it is hidden. If you start typing it in the console, auto-completion (hint) will not appear. You must know it by heart.

Not connected (FCVAR_NOT_CONNECTED):
This command cannot be changed while connected to the server. You must exit to the main menu to change it.

Replicated (FCVAR_REPLICATED):
This is a server variable. If the server sets a value, your client must set it accordingly. You cannot change it on the client if the server forces its own value.

Notify (FCVAR_NOTIFY):
If a server admin changes this command, a message about the command change is sent to all players in chat. This is designed to prevent admins from secretly changing the game rules.

User info (FCVAR_USERINFO):
The value of this variable is sent to the server as "player information."

Defensive (FCVAR_CS_DEFENSIVE):
This variable participates in the prediction and validation system. If a client attempts to change its value in a data packet, the server will reject the action or mark it as suspicious in its internal database.

Archive (FCVAR_ARCHIVE):
If a command has this flag, the parameter changed with this flag will be reset upon re-entry. Therefore, we write commands like these in autoexec.cfg to apply commands.

Command line enforced (CLI enforced):
This command's value is blocked by Steam's launch options. This is essentially a default setting for the client.

Client DLL / Game DLL:
Shows where exactly the command is forced: in the client code (your PC) or in the game logic code (server/general logic).

Linked concommand:
This is an action command (e.g., jump or disconnect).

Protected:
Used for passwords (e.g., rcon_password). The value of this command is not shared with other players and does not appear in the logs.

Singleplayer only:
Only works if you've created a local server and are playing alone (or with bots).

Demo / Don't record:
Controls whether changes to this command are recorded in the replay file.

Missing 1 / Missing 2:
This means that (Source 2 Viewer) found new flags in the game code, but hasn't yet determined what they do, so it's labeled them "Missing." VConsole fuzzy matching: Helps find this command in VConsole by fuzzy searching (missing typos).

VConsole set focus: When the command is invoked, the input focus switches to a specific window.

Menubar item: This command is added as a button to the VConsole top menu.

Client can execute: The server allows the client (you) to execute this command.

Server can execute: The command can be executed by the server console.

Clientcmd can execute: The command can be executed via a scripted call to clientcmd (used in workshop maps/mods).

Server cannot query: The server is not allowed to query your client for the value of this variable.

Execute per tick: The command is executed (called) every tick. This is a very rare flag for deep debugging or hooks.

Initial setvalue: The variable has a hard-coded initial value at engine startup.

Per user: The variable is unique for each local player.
